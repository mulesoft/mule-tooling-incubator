You acknowledge that you are obtaining only a limited license right to the Software and that irrespective of any use of the words &quot;purchase&quot;, &quot;sale&quot; or like terms hereunder no ownership rights are being conveyed to you under this Agreement or otherwise.

4. Payment.

No payment from you shall be due for any Software licensed hereunder unless MuleSoft specifically identifies any applicable fees prior to making the Software available to you for download. If any fees are so indicated, you shall pay all such fees in U.S. Dollars. If MuleSoft will be invoicing you for payment, all payments shall be made within thirty (30) days of your receipt of the applicable invoice, unless otherwise specified in writing by MuleSoft. Except as expressly set forth herein, all fees are non-refundable once paid. You shall be responsible for all taxes, withholdings, duties and levies arising from your use of the Software (if any)(excluding taxes based on the net income of MuleSoft).

(a) ceases operation without a successor; or
(b) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against such party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days)). Termination is not an exclusive remedy and the exercise by either party of any remedy under this Agreement will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law, or otherwise.
5.2 Termination.
Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, you shall cease any and all use of any Software and destroy all copies thereof (including the backup copy, if made).

Except as expressly authorized herein, you will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any MuleSoft Confidential Information. You acknowledge that disclosure of MuleSoft Confidential Information would cause substantial harm to MuleSoft that could not be remedied by the payment of damages alone and therefore that upon any such disclosure by you, MuleSoft shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law.
10. Export Compliance.

You acknowledge that the Software is subject to export restrictions by the United States government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments. You shall not, and shall not allow any third-party to, remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Software or any direct product thereof:

(ii) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department&apos;s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department&apos;s list of Specially Designated Nationals;
(iii) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the United States government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (iv) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any United States or foreign agency or authority. You agree to the foregoing and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list. The Software is further restricted from being used for the design or development of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or missile technology, or for terrorist activity, without the prior permission of the United States government.

MuleSoft may assign this Agreement to any affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of MuleSoft&apos;s assets or voting securities.

No provision of any purchase order or in any other business form employed by you will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document issued by a party hereto relating to this Agreement shall be for administrative purposes only and shall have no legal effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have entered into a separate written license agreement signed by MuleSoft for use of the Software, the terms and conditions of such other agreement shall prevail over any conflicting terms or conditions in this Agreement.

The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. There is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency created hereby between the parties. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party&apos;s behalf without the other party&apos;s prior written consent.
11.9 Force Majeure.
Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events, which occur after the signing of this Agreement and which are beyond the reasonable control of the parties, such as strikes, blockade, war, terrorism, riots, natural disasters, refusal of license by the government or other governmental agencies, in so far as such an event prevents or delays the affected party from fulfilling its obligations and such party is not able to prevent or remove the force majeure at reasonable cost.
